What to bring to class on Feb 6: 
You   must turn   in   a   hard copy of your   homework; they   should   be   identical to   the   files   you         uploaded to   LEARN@PolyU. Any variation will   be treated   as a violation   of the   honor   code.   Do   not   bring   hard   copies of your   Excel spreadsheets!
PARTIAL CREDIT   IS AVAILABLE for the following questions,   provided that your work is shown and clearly interpreted.
1. Agri-Pro   is a company that sells   agricultural   products to   farmers   in   several   states.   One   service   it
provides to   its customers   is custom feed   mixing, whereby a farmer   can   order   a   specific   amount   of
livestock feed and specify the amount   of   corn,   grain,   and   minerals the   feed   should   contain.   Agri-Pro   stocks   bulk amounts of four types of feeds that   it   can   mix to   meet   a   given   customer’s   specifications.   The following table summarizes the four feeds, their composition   of   corn,   grain,   and   minerals,   and the cost   per   pound for   each type.

$0.15 Agri-Pro   has just   received an order from   a   local chicken farmer for 8000   pounds   of feed. The   farmer   wants this feed to contain at   least   20% corn,   15% grain,   and   15%   mineral.   What   should   Agri-Pro   do      to fill this order   at   minimum   cost?
(a)      [3   points]   Define the following decision variables:X1    =   pounds of Feed   1   to   use   in   the   mixX2    =   pounds   of Feed   2 to   use in   the   mixX3    =   pounds   of Feed   3 to   use in   the   mixX4    =   pounds   of Feed 4 to   use   in   the   mix
Write down   in the space   below the objective function   and   constraints, for   the   optimization   problem   to   help Agri-Pro   decide the amount of each feed to fill the   order   at   minimum   cost.
Objective function: 
Constraints: 
(b)      [3   points] Set   up an optimization   model   in   Excel to solve this   problem.   Solve   it   using   Solver.   In the space   below,   report the objective function value found   by   Solver,   as well   as   the recommended amount for each feed.

Please perform. the analysis based on the sensitivity reports provided below, which may be  different from what you obtained in Part (b). 

(c)       [3   points]   Using the sensitivity table above, what will   happen   if   corn   requirement   is
increased from   at   least 20% to   at   least 21%?   Explain with   reference to   the   quantities   from   the sensitivity   report.
a.          Cost   will   increase   by   $5
b.          Cost will   increase   by   $40
c.            Cost will   increase   by $50
d.          It   is outside the allowable   increase   and we   need to   resolve   the   LP
2.   Hong   Kong   Farm, a   land and farming company,   plans to grow   two   types   of vegetables:   tomato   and green   pepper. The company wants to   maximize   its net profit (i.e., gross revenue minus operating cost) subject to   budget, time   (in   man days) and   land constraints. The   expected   gross   revenue, operating cost, time and   land   requirements for each   unit   of tomato   and   pepper   are:

1 The company   has set aside a   $15,000   budget,   a total   of   720   man   days   of time,   45   acres   of   land.   From   past experience, the company   decides that the amount   of tomato   should   be   at   least   half the   amount   of green   pepper and at   most twice the amount   of   green   pepper.
(a)      [4   points] Write   down   in the space   below the decision variables, objective   function,   and      constraints, for the optimization   problem to   help   Hong   Kong   Farm   decide the amount   of   vegetables to grow. Note that fraction of a unit is allowed.

(b)      [3   points] Set   up an optimization   model   in   Excel to solve this   problem.   Solve   it   using   Solver.   In the space   below,   report the objective function value found   by   Solver,   as well   as   the recommended amount for each type of vegetable.

Parts (c) and (d) are separate questions, which are unrelated to each other. Please perform the analysis based on the sensitivity reports provided below, which may be different from what you obtained in Part (b). 

(c)       [3   points] A   new   Consumer   Reports   predicts that the   revenue of tomato will   be   $670   per unit. Should the company change   its   plan?   Explain with   reference   to   the   quantities   from   the   sensitivity   report. 
(d)      [3   points] After surveying the   land, the company finds that   5   acres   of   land   are   actually   not   suitable for growing vegetables   (i.e., only 40 acres   are   available for   growing   vegetables).            How   does the company’s   net   profit change?   Explain with   reference to the   appropriate quantities from the sensitivity   report.
